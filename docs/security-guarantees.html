    <h1>Security Guarantees</h1>

    <p>
      json‑seal provides authenticity and integrity for JSON‑serializable values.
      It does this through RFC 8785 canonicalization, SHA‑256 hashing, and
      RSA‑PSS signatures. The guarantees below describe exactly what the system
      provides — and what it intentionally does not.
    </p>

    <h2>What json‑seal guarantees</h2>

    <h3>Integrity</h3>
    <p>
      Any modification to the payload or signature is detectable. Verification
      fails if even a single byte changes. Canonicalization and hashing are
      recomputed during verification to ensure correctness.
    </p>

    <h3>Authenticity</h3>
    <p>
      Only the holder of the private key can produce a valid signature. Anyone
      with the embedded public key can verify it.
    </p>

    <h3>Deterministic behavior</h3>
    <p>
      RFC 8785 canonicalization ensures that semantically identical values always
      produce the same digest and signature across environments.
    </p>

    <h3>Self‑contained verification</h3>
    <p>
      Each envelope embeds its own public key. Verification does not require
      external infrastructure, registries, or trust stores.
    </p>

    <h3>Long‑term stability</h3>
    <p>
      The envelope format is versioned. Old envelopes remain verifiable even if
      new keys are generated or the application evolves.
    </p>

    <h2>What json‑seal does not guarantee</h2>

    <h3>No confidentiality</h3>
    <p>
      Sealed values remain visible. json‑seal does not encrypt or hide data.
    </p>

    <h3>No access control</h3>
    <p>
      Anyone can verify an envelope. json‑seal does not restrict who can read or
      validate sealed data.
    </p>

    <h3>No identity binding</h3>
    <p>
      json‑seal proves that a private key created the signature, but it does not
      assert who owns that key. Identity must be layered on top.
    </p>

    <h3>No revocation</h3>
    <p>
      Once an envelope is sealed, it remains valid as long as the public key is
      trusted. json‑seal does not provide key revocation or expiration.
    </p>

    <h3>No transport security</h3>
    <p>
      json‑seal protects the data itself, not the channel. Use HTTPS or another
      secure transport when needed.
    </p>

    <h2>Threat model</h2>
    <p>
      json‑seal protects against tampering, corruption, and unauthorized
      modification of JSON data. It does not protect against key compromise,
      malicious signers, or unauthorized access to plaintext values.
    </p>

    <p>
      The system is intentionally narrow in scope. Its goal is to provide a
      clear, portable, cryptographically sound integrity layer without ceremony
      or hidden assumptions.
